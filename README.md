# mdPickers
Material Design date/time pickers built with Angular Material and Moment.js

Note: This repository was forked from [alenaksu/mdPickers](https://github.com/alenaksu/mdPickers) because of [apparent inactivity](https://github.com/alenaksu/mdPickers/issues/192). With version 1.0.0 I merged some important pull requests and added a lot of minor features myself (see [changelog](https://github.com/dpoetzsch/md-pickers/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details). In order to publish the update I renamed the package to `md-pickers` on bower. In the future will do my best to integrate further pull requests.

Note 2: This repository was forked from [the above repository](https://github.com/dpoetzsch/md-pickers) and from [this other derived fork](https://github.com/danielecinti/md-pickers) because of apparent inactivity and the need to maintain these additional features in npm, although this is to be considered legacy software, just as AngularJS.
